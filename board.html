        <h1>Board of Directors</h1>
        <p>
        The day to day operations of the PF HOA are run by an all-volunteer Board of Directors, along with help from many other committee volunteers. The Board establishes the annual dues assessment and is responsible for using the money assessed to maintain and improve HOA property and offer programs which are of value to Prairie Fields residents, thereby increasing the value of the neighborhood.  
        <br><br>
        Welcome new board members Brian Kesler and Kyle Kirchhoefer and returning board members Greg Sopa, and Tim Yardley. 
        <br><br>
        For more information, please email board@prairiefieldshoa.com
